This project is one component of FIU's larger grant "[FIU center for reducing health disparities in substance abuse & HIV in South Florida](https://taggs.hhs.gov/Detail/AwardDetail?arg_AwardNum=U54MD012393&arg_ProgOfficeCode=56)." It is a prospective longitudinal study designed to identify antecedents and consequences of electronic cigarette use at multiple assessment levels including personality, personal beliefs, social factors, and neurobiological characteristics assessed with MRI.

## Participate

If you’re a teen between the ages of 14 to 17 years old who doesn’t vape or use e-cigarettes, or if you’re a teen who has, you may qualify to participate in this project. Participation will involve up to five visits to FIU’s main campus to complete questionnaires and brain imaging. Participants will be paid up to $400 for completely all aspects of the project.
