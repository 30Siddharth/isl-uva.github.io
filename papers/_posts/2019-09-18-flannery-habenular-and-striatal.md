# Abstract

Although tobacco use disorder is linked with functional alterations in the striatum, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and insula, preclinical evidence also implicates the habenula as a contributor to negative reinforcement mechanisms maintaining nicotine use. The habenula is a small and understudied epithalamic nucleus involved in reward and aversive processing that is hypothesized to be hyperactive during nicotine withdrawal thereby contributing to anhedonia. In a pharmacologic fMRI study involving administration of nicotine and varenicline, two relatively efficacious cessation aids, we utilized a positive and negative performance feedback task previously shown to differentially activate the striatum and habenula. By administering these nicotinic drugs (vs. placebos) to both overnight abstinent smokers (n=24) and nonsmokers (n=20), we delineated feedback-related functional alterations both as a function of a chronic smoking history (trait: smokers vs. nonsmokers) and as a function of drug administration (state: nicotine, varenicline). We observed that smokers showed less ventral striatal responsivity to positive feedback, an alteration not mitigated by drug administration, but rather correlated with higher trait-level addiction severity among smokers and elevated self-reported negative affect across all participants. Conversely, nicotine administration reduced habenula activity following both positive and negative feedback among abstinent smokers, but not nonsmokers; greater habenula activity correlated with elevated abstinence-induced, state-level tobacco craving among smokers and elevated social anhedonia across all participants. These outcomes highlight a dissociation between neurobiological processes linked with the trait of dependence severity and with the state of acute nicotine withdrawal. Interventions simultaneously targeting both aspects may improve currently poor cessation outcomes.
