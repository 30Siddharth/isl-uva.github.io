# Purpose

This is where you'll find the most up-to-date information on who we are, what we're working on, what we've done, and how we did it (and you can, too).


# Design and Implementation

I'm inspired by [Trevor Bedford]'s clean, elegant, and functional [site][1]. More than inspired! I've copied many aspects of his site, from visual design to conceptual organization to under-the-hood code, at Trevor's (public) invitation. Rather than branching his code, I started from a different boilerplate, as described below, and adopted/adapted many of his choices during customization.

I took a relatively simple route to get up and running. The site started with [Jekyll Bootstrap] with various customizations. The primary implementation choice atop the JB framework---inspired by Trevor's choices---was to treat each major section of the site (papers, protocols, news) as a blog-like object. A few mods to the Rakefile help with creating new posts and papers.

The site is deployed using [GitHub Pages], which combines source-code control and hosting in a most pleasant way. Modify, test locally, push, and it's live.

In using [Sass] for stylesheets, the site gets virtually all the advantages of using [Less], while exploiting native Sass support by [Github Pages]. I use Google Fonts as well.
