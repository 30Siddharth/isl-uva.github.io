# Purpose

This is where you'll find the most up-to-date information on who we are, what we're working on, what we've done, and how we did it (and you can, too).


# Design and Implementation

I'm inspired by [Trevor Bedford]'s clean, elegant, and functional [site][1]. More than inspired: I have copied many aspects of it, from visual design to conceptual organization to under-the-hood code, at Trevor's (public) invitation. This section serves as my formal thanks to Trevor for his work and his generosity.

I took a relatively simple route to get up and running. The site started with [Jekyll Bootstrap] with various customizations. The primary implementation choice atop the JB framework---inspired by Trevor's choices---was to treat each major section of the site (papers, protocols, news) as a blog-like object.

The site is deployed using [GitHub Pages], which combines source-code control and hosting in a most pleasant way. Modify, test locally, push, and it's live.
