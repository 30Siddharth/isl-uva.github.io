Testing MathJax.

Here is an example MathJax inline rendering \\( 1/x^{2} \\), and here is a block rendering: 
\\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \\]

Now, if we'd like to get serious we'd do $$e^{2 \pi i \omega t}$$ or even \\(\int_{i=0}^{\infty} e^{\frac{-2 \mu t}{2 \sigma^2}} dt\\).

Or we could try defining a command, like this. \\( 	\newcommand{\water}{H_{2}O} \\)

\\(\water\\) is like \\(\water\\).
