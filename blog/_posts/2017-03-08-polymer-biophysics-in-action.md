Polymer biophysics elucidates the principles governing the organized demixing of molecules inside of cells. Protein and RNA can demix into massive assemblies such as gels, liquids, and fibers. They lack a fixed stoichiometry so we refer to them as quinary assemblies. We focus on the properties of assemblies composed of poly(A)-binding protein (Pab1) that form in eukaryotic cells in response to cellular stress.  We find that the demixing of Pab1 has been tuned for rapid response to stress and is beneficial for surviving that stress. For those who wish to dive into the paper, please proceed [here]. Since our story differs significantly from the current results in the field, I have focused this blog post on what polymer biophysics I expected would govern Pab1 demixing vs. reality. # Polymer biophysics of Pab1: ExpectationsPrior to obtaining data, The principles I expected were going to govern Pab1 demixing primarily based on my reading of the literature are: 1. Pab1 would have an intrinsically disordered region ( ‘IDR’ or non-foldable low complexity regions) that would allow different Pab1 molecules to flexibly interact in the quinary assembly.2. Demixing would be favorable due to multivalent interactions between RNA and Pab1 and between IDRs on different Pab1 molecules.3. Pab1’s IDR would promote demixing through interactions between charge, aromatic, or polar residues (ie coulomb interactions or hydrogen bonds) and not from aliphatic residues because they are strongly depleted in IDRs. The interacting residues would be enriched in the composition of the IDR.4. Pab1’s IDR would be collapsed. When demixed Pab1’s IDR would interact with other Pab1 molecules but when monomeric (‘mixed’) Pab1’s IDR would have self-interactions yielding collapse of Pab1.# Polymer biophysics of Pab1: Reality## Expectation: #1 > Pab1 would have an IDR that would allow different Pab1 molecules to flexibly interact in the quinary assembly.- [x] Pab1 has an IDR initially denoted the proline-rich domain or P domain. 
- [x] We show deletion of the P domain perturbs stress-triggered demixing of Pab1 into quinary assemblies in vitro and in vivo and has been previously shown to result in a temperature dependent phenotype. ## Expectation: #2> Demixing would require multivalent interactions between RNA and Pab1 and/or between IDRs on different Pab1 molecules.- [ ] Not only does Pab1 not require RNA for pH or heat triggered demixing *in vitro* but it is destabilizes it. How does this work in cells? Chris considers this further in his [FAQ section]- [ ] Although the P domain is the strongest single domain enhancer of demixing, it is not required for demixing. Multivalent Interactions between Pab1’s folded domains are required and determine Pab1’s phase behavior such as its salt and pH sensitivity. Splitting the protein in half yields a half without the IDR that can demix and a half with the IDR that cannot.## Expectation: #3
> Pab1’s IDR would promote demixing through interactions between charge, aromatic, or polar residues (ie coulomb interactions or hydrogen bonds) and not from aliphatic residues because they are strongly depleted in IDRs. The interacting residues would be enriched in the composition of the IDR.Before addressing this question lets compare the P domain sequence and composition in yeast Pab1 with that of the RGG domain, an IDR necessary for demixing of the P-granule protein LAF-1 *in vitro*. ![CompositionPdomain](https://github.com/drummondlab/drummondlab.github.io/blob/staging/assets/images/JAR_compositionPDOMandRGGDOM.png)
For clarity the compositional plots are fraction residues of each type, and for the evolutionary composition plot, each row is a different species. The hydrophobicity of the residue groups are roughly aromatic, aliphatic, small, polar, charged from most to least hydrophobic  - [ ] The P domain is strongly depleted for charged residues. This composition feature is conserved.- [ ] The P domain doesn’t have unusual polar or aromatic content. This is conserved.- [ ] The P domain is unusually hydrophobic and these are key--- hydrophobic residues are interacting and stabilizing demixing. ## Expectation: #4
> Pab1’s IDR would be collapsed. When demixed Pab1’s IDR would interact with other Pab1 molecules but when monomeric (‘mixed’)  Pab1’s IDR would have self-interactions yielding collapse of Pab1.This is a concept drawn from 101 polymer physics. If IDR-IDR interactions are sufficiently strong, then the IDR will either collapse if at low concentration or demix if at sufficiently high concentration. Here is a picture:
![IDRCOLLAPSEANDAGG](https://github.com/drummondlab/drummondlab.github.io/blob/staging/assets/images/JAR_IDRcollapseANDagg.png)- [x] The P domain is collapsed. It behaves as expected for a weakly packed, dynamic globule. Extreme mutations such as changing the 15% of the sequence that is glycine to either alanine or proline maintains its collapse. Even randomly changing the order of ALL the residues in the domain maintains collapse. 
- [x] The extent of P domain collapse correlates with the enhancement of Pab1 demixing *in vivo*, *in vitro*, and survival during stress.   # Expectation vs. Reality Summary

\#|Expectation|Reality|Expectation~Reality
---|---|---|---
1|Pab1 has IDR | IDR (P domain) exits and conserved in eukaryotes|Yes
2|Demixing requires RNA:Pab1 interactions and IDR:IDR interactions | Demixing requires only folded domains|No 3|IDR promotes demixing with charge, aromatic, or polar residues | Net hydrophobicity of amino acid residues enhances demixing|No4|IDR is collapsed. Extent of IDR collapse would correlate with enhancing demixing|Size of IDR correlates with the temperature of demixing *in vivo* and *in vitro*|Yes# Questions remain
Why folded domains nessisary? Etc etcSincerely,
