{% include JB/setup %}

A handful members of the cognitive neuroscience program at FIU are huge fans of the [bctpy]() toolbox, but wanted to make substantial changes independently of `bctpy`'s development. In order to release our changes (while still respecting original `bctpy` development and licensing), we renamed our fork to `brainconn` and are working to reorganize and develop the package.

Check out the brainconn [documentation](https://brainconn.readthedocs.io) or see the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/FIU-Neuro/brainconn).
