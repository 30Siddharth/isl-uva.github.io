O Drummond Lab
==============
(to the tune of "Shenandoah")

O Drummond lab, how I shall miss you,  
At the bench and the computer,  
And all the fine science that you do.  
Away, I must away, across the vast Atlantic.  

For five long years I've toiled away,  
At the bench and the computer,  
Measuring proteins and RNA.  
Away, I must away, across the vast Atlantic.  

All you have taught me so, so much,  
At the bench and the computer,  
Of biochemistry, evolution, cell biology, statistics, biophysics[*], and such.  
Away, I must away, across the vast Atlantic.  

O Drummond lab, you lovely colleagues,  
At the bench and the computer,  
And a quintillion heat-shocked yeasties.  
Away, I must away, across the vast Atlantic.  

[*]: Creative interpretation is needed to fit all these fields in a single line, or single postdoc.
