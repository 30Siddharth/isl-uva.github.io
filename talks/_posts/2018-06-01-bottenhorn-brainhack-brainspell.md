Katie gave this data blitz about the new [Brainspell](https://github.com/akeshavan/brainspell-neo-frontend) frontend tool [metaCurious](https://metacurious.org/) (in development at the time of the talk) at the Miami BrainHack Global event. Bringing together human cleverness and big data, metaCurious is a tool to help you curate and annotate version-controlled collections of neuroimaging articles for meta-analyses. This tool facilitates collaboration and reproducibility by building sharable collections as GitHub repositories, providing a front end to Brainspell-neo, which started from Roberto Toro's Brainspell, itself based on Tal Yarkoni's NeuroSynth: standing on the shoulders of Giants!
