In the Neuroinformatics and Brain Connectivity lab, we place a lot of emphasis
on contributing to open source software. Some projects that lab members have
contributed to include [Nipype](https://github.com/nipy/nipype),
[Nistats](https://github.com/nistats/nistats),
[Neurosynth](https://github.com/neurosynth/neurosynth),
[PyBIDS](https://github.com/INCF/pybids), and
[tedana](https://github.com/ME-ICA/tedana). Feel free to check out the [lab's repositories](https://github.com/NBCLab) and lab member's pages on GitHub.

We are also involved in a number of other packages, whether as project leaders
or as major contributors. If you are interested in contributing to any of the
packages below, please consult the contributing guidelines and code of conduct
provided in the package's GitHub repository.
