# Introduction

The habenula (Hb) is a small epithalamic nucleus that modulates monoamine neurotransmission, possesses a high density of nAChRs, and is linked with the aversive effects of high nicotine doses & nicotine withdrawal symptoms. While the striatum, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and insula are regarded as constituents in the neurocircuitry of addiction, preclinical evidence implicates the Hb as an additional contributor to negative reinforcement mechanisms perpetuating smoking. Although the Hbâ€™s small size leads to difficulty assessing its function in humans, we utilized a feedback task previously shown to differentially activate the Hb, striatum, ACC, & insula.
