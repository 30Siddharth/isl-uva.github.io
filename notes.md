## Layout

I'm inspired by [Trevor Bedford]'s clean, functional [site][1]. I intend to copy it---part of Trevor's intent---and here make a note by way of crediting him.
You're welcome to borrow / repurpose code to build your own site, but I would very much appreciate attribution and a link back to bedford.io from your about page.

* Home
	* Research
	* Papers
		* Queuosine modification of tRNA and codon usage
		* The relationship between mRNA and protein levels
		* Heat triggers reversible...
	* Team
	* Blog
	* Protocols
	* Misc
		* About
		* Join
		* Contact

Each of the major areas is structured like a blog. That is:

	papers/
		_posts/
			2014-12-09-queuosine.md
			2015-04-18-mrna-protein.md
	protocols/
		_posts/

## To do

* Home page
* Font
* Centering
* Blog post on what is happening here, experiences getting up and running.
