[Lauren Hill-Bowen](/team/hill-lauren) and [Ranjita Poudel](/team/poudel-ranjita)have received $5000 to fund the proposed pilot project entitled, "Altered reward processing and chronic nicotine use: Training, preprocessing, and analysis of an existing simultaneous EEG-fMRI dataset". This project will leverage an existing electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset to provide enhanced
understanding of the brain processes linked with chronic nicotine exposure and acute therapeutic administration. [Jessica Flannery](/team/flannery-jessica) has also been awarded $5000 to fund the proposed pilot project, "Behavioral approach toward electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) stimuli and future use intentions among middle schoolers." This project will supplement data collection efforts of The ACE Project, an ongoing, large-scale, longitudinal study by expanding the age range of participants to also include middle school students. This project will develop and employ an additional behavioral task called the Approach Avoidance Task that has potential to predict future ENDS use.
