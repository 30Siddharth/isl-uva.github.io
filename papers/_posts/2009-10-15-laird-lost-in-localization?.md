# Abstract

The recent commentary by Derrfuss J, Mar RA. (2009). Lost in localization: the need for a universal coordinate database. Neuroimage, In Press proposed a universal coordinate database to archive functional neuroimaging results. In this response, we discuss our strategy in developing the BrainMap database, which was created as a mechanism to promote coordinate-based meta-analysis methods.
