What are quinary assemblies? – they are biological assemblies with no fixed number of particles including protein phases such as fibers, gels, and liquids. Pab1’s quinary assemblies are later assembled into larger observable foci called ‘stress granules’. A recent focus on enumerating the biophysical properties of proteins capable of forming quinary assemblies, *in vivo* and/or *in vitro* has dominated this field, which I refer to as ‘polymer biophysics’. Yet demonstrating that a quinary assembly is beneficial for cellular fitness has remained elusive. – our system is an exception. For those who wish to dive into the paper, please proceed [here]. Since scientific jargon, limited publishing space, and reviewer 3 can sometimes hinder full communication of everything we perceive the reader should conclude in our paper, I have wrote this blogpost to focus on elements lacking the space they deserve. For me, as a biophysist, I chose to focus on the impact for the biophysical principles promoting triggered demixing. # Polymer biophysics of Pab1: ExpectationsPrior to obtaining data, I had expectations on the molecular principles that were likely to govern Pab1’s triggered demixing primarily based on my reading of the literature. Here they are: 1. Pab1 would have an intrinsically disordered region ( ‘IDR’ or non-foldable low complexity regions) that would allow different Pab1 molecules to flexibly interact in the quinary assembly.2. Demixing would be favorable due to multivalent interactions between RNA and Pab1 and between IDRs on different Pab1 molecules.3. Pab1’s IDR would promote demixing through interactions between charge, aromatic, or polar residues (ie coulomb interactions or hydrogen bonds) and not from aliphatic residues because they are strongly depleted in IDRs. The interacting residues would be enriched in the composition of the IDR and conserved.4. Pab1’s IDR would be collapsed. When demixed Pab1’s IDR would interact with other Pab1 molecules but when monomeric (‘mixed’)  Pab1’s IDR would have self-interactions yielding collapse of Pab1.# Polymer biophysics of Pab1: Reality## Expectation: #1 > Pab1 would have an IDR that would allow different Pab1 molecules to flexibly interact in the quinary assembly.- [x] Pab1 has an IDR initially denoted the proline-rich domain or P domain. - [x] We show deletion of the P domain perturbs stress-triggered demixing of Pab1 into quinary assemblies in vitro and in vivo and has been previously shown to result in a temperature dependent phenotype. > 2. Demixing would require multivalent interactions between RNA and Pab1 and/or between IDRs on different Pab1 molecules.- [ ] Not only does Pab1 not require RNA for pH or heat triggered demixing *in vitro* but it is destabilizes it. How does this work in cells? Chris considers this further in his [FAQ section]- [ ] Although the P domain is the strongest single domain enhancer of demixing, it is not required for demixing. Multivalent Interactions between (multiple) Pab1’s folded domains are required and determine Pab1’s phase behavior such as its salt and pH sensitivity. Splitting the protein in half yields a half without the IDR that can demix and a half with the IDR that cannot.> 3. Pab1’s IDR would promote demixing through interactions between charge, aromatic, or polar residues (ie coulomb interactions or hydrogen bonds) and not from aliphatic residues because they are strongly depleted in IDRs. The interacting residues would be enriched in the composition of the IDR and conserved.Before addressing this question lets compare the P domain sequence and composition in yeast Pab1 with that of the RGG domain, an IDR necessary for demixing of the P-body protein LAF-1 *in vitro*. ![CompositionPdomain](https://github.com/drummondlab/drummondlab.github.io/blob/staging/assets/images/JAR_compositionPDOMandRGGDOM.png)
For clarity the compositional plots are fraction residues of each type, and for the evolutionary composition plot, each row is a different species. The hydrophobicity of the residue groups are roughly aromatic, aliphatic, small, polar, charged from most to least hydrophobic  - [ ] The P domain is strongly depleted for charged residues (6% in yeast). This composition feature is conserved.- [ ] The P domain doesn’t have unusual polar (37%) or aromatic content (12%). This is conserved.- [ ] The P domain is unusually hydrophobic and these are key--- hydrophobic residues are interacting and stabilizing demixing. > 4. Pab1’s IDR would be collapsed. When demixed Pab1’s IDR would interact with other Pab1 molecules but when monomeric (‘mixed’)  Pab1’s IDR would have self-interactions yielding collapse of Pab1.This is a concept drawn from 101 polymer physics. If IDR-IDR interactions are sufficiently strong, then the IDR will either collapse if at low concentration or demix if at sufficiently high concentration. ![IDRCOLLAPSEANDAGG](https://github.com/drummondlab/drummondlab.github.io/blob/staging/assets/images/JAR_IDRcollapseANDagg.png)- [x] The P domain is collapsed. It behaves as expected for a polymer weakly packed, dynamic globule. Crazy mutations such as changing the 15% of the sequence that is glycine to either alanine or proline maintains its collapse. Even randomly changing the order of the residues in the domain maintains collapse. - [x] The extent of P domain collapse correlates with the enhancement of Pab1 demixing *in vivo*, *in vitro*, and survival during stress.   # That’s Polymer Biophysics in practice. That is my two cents on how Pab1 has advanced my understanding of polymer biophysics. More biologically important quinary assemblies will be needed to understand the exact selection principles that yielded the dynamic Pab1 and its P domain.Sincerely,Josh
