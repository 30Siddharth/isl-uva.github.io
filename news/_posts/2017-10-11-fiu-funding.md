Exciting news! A team of FIU scientists has been awarded a $13.1 million grant from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD/NIH) to build Florida's first Health Disparities Research Center at a Minority Institution (RCMI). The focus of the FIU-RCMI is on reducing substance abuse problems and HIV/sexually transmitted infections among teenagers and young adults through community research partnerships in South Florida and across the country. FIU-RCMI is directed by Dr. Eric Wagner, involves 34 faculty members from various disciplines across the university, and is composed of multiple cores and a larger scale research project. This 5-year research project examines risk and protective factors that lead to electronic cigarette use among teenagers and the impact of electronic cigarette use on the developing brain. Drs. Trucco and Sutherland are the principal investigators of this research project. Congratulations to all!
