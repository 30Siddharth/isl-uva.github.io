We've just published a [paper][1] on how cells respond to heat stress.

### What did we do?

We measured heat-induced protein aggregation and disaggregation.

We discovered that endogenous protein aggregates that form after heat stress are fully reversible, form rapidly at specific locations, and in certain cases retain function and fidelity in vitro. 

The behavior of endogenous, mature proteins in vivo does not match expectations from studies that use exogenous/reporter proteins or that focus on newly synthesized proteins.

### Ideas

What looked like heat-induced protein damage followed by triage and degradation instead looks like an orderly, evolved regulatory response.


### Irresponsible speculations

Heat-induced protein aggregation has been seen as mostly _physics_, but (for proteins that actually aggregate during heat shock) it'll turn out to be mostly _biology_. The vast majority of aggregation in the cell in response to heat shock will prove to be beneficial. And not just by preventing toxicity, the way amyloid fibrils are often argued to be beneficial, but by carrying out critical cellular remodeling functions.

Primary among those functions: focusing cellular protein synthesis on mRNAs encoding stress-responsive proteins.

## Picture, please

For the science, there's no substitute for reading the [paper][1]. Here, I want to talk a little bit about how to think about what's going on in the cell, given our study and everything else we know.

Here is the idyllic campus of the Cellular Institute with its manicured grounds and main building. Happy workers (proteins) go about their often inscrutable business.

When suddenly: *catastrophe*. A fire breaks out. (Heat shock!) What happens?

What has long been observed---blurrily, as if from orbit, because our  aren't so great---is that suddenly the workers move to particular places and gather together in big groups.

Then after a little while, emergency crews show up, and some time after that, everything's back to normal.

So what's going on? 

Most previous work has guessed, for many good empirical reasons, that mainly what's going on is that the workers are distressed, damaged, even dying. The clumping together is because---horribly---heat partially melts them and makes them sticky. Of course, these workers stop working. Some of them can be rescued; many of them are beyond saving. The emergency crews triage victims and dispose of the bodies.

The alternative is that the institute has in place disaster-preparedness plans.

The emergency crew shows up and tends to the few workers who are actually injured. When they're done, the crew helps the assembled workers back to their original jobs.

## How the study unfolded

Way back in the day, we spent a lot of time developing cryogenic lysis and cellular fractionation (total, supernatant, pellet) methods for budding yeast. Mike Dion did seemingly endless studies on lysis by all sorts of methods. 

We'd also developed our mass spec capabilities to be able to do proteomics. We wanted to know what proteins formed aggregates under normal conditions in yeast cells. So Mike did what we thought was a simple study: proteome-scale in vivo thermal denaturation. 

Heat up yeast cells to 50C for two to eight minutes, which (we thought) was certain to cause proteins to unfold; spin down the aggregates; and quantify which proteins were more "thermolabile," fancy-talk for "can't stand the heat."

Well, lots of proteins formed aggregates, but we couldn't see any rhyme or reason to it. I'd thought, based on [previous][2] [work][3], that low-expression proteins would be
