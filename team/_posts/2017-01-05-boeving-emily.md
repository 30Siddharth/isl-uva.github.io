Emily is a third-year doctoral student in the Department of Psychology with dual specialization in Developmental Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience at FIU. She previously earned an M.Sc. in Evolutionary Anthropology from Durham University (UK), and a B.S. in Psychology from Ouachita Baptist University. Emilyâ€™s research focuses on quantifying sociality in human and non-human primates. She is currently utilizing fMRI to characterize the interplay of social and cognitive development, and is developing a novel approach for assessing relationships between social behavior and functional brain connectivity in humans. Emily is working on the NIH funded Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, investigating relationships between social factors, cognition, and brain network development in pediatric populations.
