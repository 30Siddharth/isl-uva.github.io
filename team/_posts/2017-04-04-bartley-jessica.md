Jessica is a fifth-year graduate student in the Department of Physics at Florida International University. She previously earned a Masters in Physics from FIU and Bachelor of Arts degrees in Physics and Math at the University of Colorado (Boulder, CO) where she completed a thesis in physics education research. Her research focuses on understanding the neural mechanisms involved in student physics learning. This NSF-funded project uses functional magnetic resonance imaging to identify brain networks engaged during physics reasoning. Jessica is ultimately interested in applying this interdisciplinary neuroimaging and education research towards developing a better understanding of how learning environments impact the neural development of studentsâ€™ brain networks.
