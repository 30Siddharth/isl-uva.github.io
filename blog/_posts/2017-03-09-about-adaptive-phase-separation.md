We've just published a [paper][1] on how cells respond to heat stress.

### A bit of background

Like us, cells react to stresses like heat, starvation, and poison. All these stresses cause clumps of molecules to form inside cells. This clumping---aggregation---looks like damaged proteins sticking together. But in our last [paper][agg], we showed that instead, these clumps look like they're a cellular response, not just signs of damage. (See our [blog post][agg-blog] on it.)

We're going to go back to the Cellular Institute with its manicured grounds and main building. Happy workers (proteins) go about their often inscrutable business.

The Institute is constantly dealing with awful changes in its environment. The mission is to survive, even to keep growing, during those tough times.

Is clumping damage or response? A key test is to see what happens when you stop the clumping during stress. Stopping damage during stress should make cells healthier. Stopping a stress response, on the other hand, would make cells sicker.

### Doesn't sound too complicated

Easy for you to say, headline! In our study, we had to first find a protein that formed clumps during stress, then figure out how to control its clumping without screwing up a bunch of other stuff (which involved quite a bit of figuring out why it formed clumps, physically, and which bits of the molecule were responsible). Doing all that required working on the protein in isolation in a test tube, so then we had to put the protein back into cells and check to see if it worked the same way as it did in the tube. Finally, we could expose those cells to stress and see how they responded.

### What did we do?

We picked out a specific protein that formed clumps during stress: poly(A)-binding protein, which is nicknamed Pab1 in baker's yeast, our beautiful and hardy model organism. (Relatives of Pab1 are found in essentially every cell that has a nucleus, from plants to parasites to people.) We purified Pab1, put it in a dish, and exposed it to the same intracellular conditions that follow stress and are thought to cause clumping, heat and pH. Yeast cells like to live in acidic (low-pH) environments, but keep their insides at neutral pH. When cells get stressed, their internal pH drops, becoming more acidic. That, others have argued, might cause clumping during non-heat stresses like starvation.

### What did we find?

First, we discovered that Pab1 "clumping" was something rather specific and wonderful: phase separation into hydrogel droplets.

Phase separation is like a flash crowd. Under certain conditions, suddenly a mixture of two kinds of molecules separates ("demixes") like oil and water. Bunches of recent studies have shown proteins doing this trick, usually under exotic conditions.

Pab1 phase-separates in response to both pH and temperature, right at the stress-associated ranges of each one.

This paper was five years from initial discovery (by Alexandra Rojek, an undergraduate summer researcher) to publication. There's a lot in there (though the reviewers wanted oh so much more!). For experts, our results are full of surprises. First author [Josh] has blogged about some of the [biophysical aspects].

And there's much more to do. How, exactly, does Pab1's phase separation help the cell? We share some ideas in the paper. Watch this space as the story continues to, well, come together.
