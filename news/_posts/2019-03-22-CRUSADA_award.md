excerpt: [Dr. Micheal Riedel](/team/riedel-micheal) (Principle Investigator), [Dr. Matthew Sutherland](/team/sutherland-matthew) (Key Associate) and graduate student [Jessica Flannery](/team/flannery-jessica) (Key Associate) were awarded funding from The Center for Research on US Latino HIV/AIDS and Drug Abuse (CRUSADA) Supplemental Pilot Studies Program  to support their supplemental pilot project: “Sociocultural factors impacting reward processing and electronic nicotine delivery system use among Latino teens”.

The CRUSADA Supplemental Pilot Studies Program funds grant applications for pilot studies that focus on substance abuse, HIV, obesity, mental health, and violence/trauma health disparities with Latino and other vulnerable populations that are supplemental to an existing NIH-funded research grant. The funded two year pilot project will aim to expand the focus of the parent project: The [ACE Project](/projects/ace) by characterizing neurocognitive mechanisms linked with ENDS use among the rapidly growing and understudied population of adolescent ENDS users and delineating the degree to which sociocultural factors impact neurocognitive characteristics and/or nicotine use motivations, particularly among Latino teens.
