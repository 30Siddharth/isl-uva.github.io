Dr. Wallace is a postdoctoral scholar in the Drummond lab at the [University of Chicago] in the Department of [Biochemistry & Molecular Biology]. 

Dr. Wallace received his Ph.D. in [Mathematics](UCMath), also at the [University of Chicago], working with [Jack Cowan](http://neuroscience.uchicago.edu/?p=neuro/profile&id=63) on stochastic dynamics of biological networks. He joined the Drummond lab, at [FAS Center for Systems Biology](http://sysbio.harvard.edu/home), in 2010, and has since added experimental work to his computational training.

In January 2016, Dr. Wallace will start a [Marie Curie fellowship](http://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/) at The University of Edinburgh, working with [Guido Sanguinetti](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/gsanguin/) and [Jean Beggs](http://beggs.bio.ed.ac.uk/).
