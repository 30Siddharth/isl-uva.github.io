NBC Lab personnel and colleagues have published a noteworthy empirical [article](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/5/10/eaax2084) entitled "Habenular and striatal activity during performance feedback are differentially linked with state-like and trait-like aspects of tobacco use disorder" to Science Advances's Special Issue on Addiction. [Dr. Matthew Sutherland](/team/sutherland-matthew)(corresponding author) and [Jessica Flannery](/team/flannery-jessica)(first author) have worked to distribute the publication's scientific findings and significance for public health efforts regarding nicotine use to University and other news outlets. Specifically, the empirical findings reported in this publication have been covered by an [article](https://news.fiu.edu/2019/medicines-to-help-smokers-quit-only-fight-half-the-battle) in Florida International University news and by a [segment](https://www.univision.com/local/miami-wltv/estudio-de-fiu-podria-revelar-la-razon-por-la-que-tantos-adictos-no-pueden-dejar-de-fumar) on Univision television network news.

The outcomes of this study highlight a dissociation between neurobiological processes linked with the dependence severity trait and the nicotine withdrawal state. Interventions simultaneously targeting both aspects may improve currently poor cessation outcomes.
