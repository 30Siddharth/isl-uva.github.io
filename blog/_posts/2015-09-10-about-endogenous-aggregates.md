We've just published a [paper][1] on how cells respond to heat stress. 

# Empirical takeaways
We find that protein aggregates that form after heat stress are fully reversible, form rapidly at specific locations, and in certain cases retain function and fidelity in vitro. We  proteome-scale quantitative picture of heat-induced aggregation and disaggregation in any organism.

# Conceptual takeaways

What looked like heat-induced protein damage followed by triage and degradation instead looks like an orderly, evolved regulatory response.

The behavior of endogenous, mature proteins in vivo does not match expectations from

Here's the idea.
